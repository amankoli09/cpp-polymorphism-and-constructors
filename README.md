## 📘 Detailed Explanation

### 🔹 What is Polymorphism in C++?
Polymorphism is an Object-Oriented Programming concept that allows the same function or method name to behave differently based on the object that is calling it.

In C++, polymorphism is mainly of two types:
- **Compile-time Polymorphism** (Function Overloading)
- **Runtime Polymorphism** (Function Overriding using virtual functions)

This repository contains simple programs that demonstrate both types using real-world examples.

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

You can compile and run any file using a C++ compiler like `g++`.

Example:
```bash
g++ Runtime\ Polymorphism.cpp -o output
./output
